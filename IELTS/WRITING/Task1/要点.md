This graph shows the average monthly change in the prices of three different metals (coopers, nickel and zinc) during 2014. Here is the analysis about this graph.

Starting at 6%, the zinc had the highest changing rate among these three metals, followed by falling sharply in next two months. And zinc's rate fluctuated around about 1% from April to May, before it dropped abruptly to -3%, which was the lowest level of this years. After this decrease, it was rising gradually and remained stable at the 1% until the end of the year.

Differing from the zinc, nickel started at the 1%, which was the lowest among these three. Although increasing immediately three times more in the February, it was soon on a smooth decrease unticl reach the lowest level in the June. After experiencing fluctuation for about four months, it grew dramatically until the 2% in the December.

As for copper, compared with the orthers, was much steadier. In this whole year, the changing rate nearly stayed constant at about 1%.

Overall, this graph has shown us the change rate of these three metal prices in 2014. And the Zinc is the one that fluctuates most sharply as the copper is the most steadily.

The line graph provides a detailed comparison of the average monthly price changes for copper, nickel, and zinc throughout 2014.

Initially, zinc prices **surged** by approximately 6% in January before **plummeting** to just above the baseline by March. Following a period of minor fluctuations, a dramatic decline to -3% **ensued** in July, after which zinc prices gradually **recovered** to around 1%, **maintaining this level** until the end of the year.

In contrast, nickel prices **began modestly** at 1% and saw a **substantial** increase to roughly 3% in February, marking the highest point of the year for this metal. This **spike** was **short-lived** as prices **dipped back** to -2% by June, **oscillating** with mild **volatility** before **ascending** to 2% in December.

Copper prices showcased remarkable stability relative to the other metals, **hovering** persistently around the 1% mark throughout the year, with **negligible** variations.

In summary, while zinc's price changes were the most **volatile**, peaking and plummeting dramatically within the year, copper demonstrated **remarkable** price **stability**, and nickel, after initial volatility, ended the year with a **moderate** increase.

This example demonstrates the clear, **concise** summarization of data points, accurate vocabulary, variety in sentence structures, and a thorough comparison of the trends among the three metals.

The charts below give information about the number of train passengers and the percentage of trains running on time from 2000 to 2009 in Japan.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant

![image-20240302220758451](file:///E:/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E7%BD%91%E7%9B%98/BaiduSyncdisk/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D/1/%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C/assets/image-20240302220758451.png?lastModify=1732460066)

The given charts depict the trends in train usage and punctuality in Japan over a decade, from 2000 to 2009. One chart tracks the number of passengers traveling by train, measured in millions, while the other compares the actual percentage of trains arriving on time against a set target.

It is evident from the data that the number of train passengers remained relatively stable, starting at just under 40 million in 2000 and experiencing slight fluctuations throughout the decade. There was a notable dip in 2005, where passenger numbers fell below 35 million, but the overall trend remained above this figure, concluding the period with a slight increase in 2009.

In contrast, the punctuality of train services showed more variability. The target line for on-time trains was set at a steady 95%. Actual performance was consistently above this benchmark in the initial years, reaching its peak at nearly 97% in 2002. However, there was a significant downturn in punctuality starting in 2005, with on-time performance plummeting to 91% by 2006, well below the target. This downward trend reversed dramatically in the following years, with a sharp recovery back to the target level in 2009.

The juxtaposition of the two charts suggests that while the number of passengers using trains in Japan remained consistently high, the efficiency of the service in terms of punctuality faced challenges, particularly in the middle of the decade. However, the recovery in the percentage of trains running on time by the end of the period indicates an improvement in service performance, aligning with the set targets.

### 例题四：两幅图

The line graphs show the size of the ozone hole in Antarctic and three types of damaging gases that damage the Antarctic ozone from 1980 to 2000. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

![image-20240302220707886](file:///E:/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E7%BD%91%E7%9B%98/BaiduSyncdisk/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D/1/%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C/assets/image-20240302220707886.png?lastModify=1732460066)![image-20240302220716565](file:///E:/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E7%BD%91%E7%9B%98/BaiduSyncdisk/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D/1/%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C/assets/image-20240302220716565.png?lastModify=1732460066)

The line graphs provide a comparative analysis of the expansion of the Antarctic ozone hole and the production of three ozone-depleting gases between 1980 and 2000. It is evident that there is a correlation between the two, with the size of the ozone hole increasing as the emissions of certain gases rise.

From 1980 to 2000, the ozone hole area expanded substantially from approximately 1 million square kilometers to nearly 25 million square kilometers. The most significant growth occurred between 1980 and 1990, after which the increase continued at a slower rate.

In terms of gas emissions, Freon and H2O2 show opposite trends. Freon production, starting at about 70 thousand metric tonnes, peaked at around 180 thousand in 1990, coinciding with the most drastic rise in the ozone hole. Post-1990, Freon levels declined steadily, ending at just above 100 thousand metric tonnes, which may explain the slower expansion rate of the ozone hole during the 1990s. Meanwhile, H2O2 production remained relatively low and stable, beginning and ending the period at around 20 thousand metric tonnes.

Conversely, NO2 production displayed an upward trend, starting at approximately 30 thousand metric tonnes and reaching about 140 thousand by 2000. The increase in NO2 after 1990 may have contributed to the continued but less pronounced growth of the ozone hole size.

Overall, the data indicates that the reduction in Freon production correlates with a decrease in the growth rate of the ozone hole's size, while the increase in NO2 production coincides with its continued expansion. The constant low output of H2O2 suggests it had little impact on the ozone hole over this period.

## **Part 3：饼状图（Pie Chart）**

雅思考试里的饼状图可以分为三大类，在拿到题目时就要决定是属于哪一类，因为不同的分类，写作的思路会完全不一样。

**>> 第一类：**单一个饼图。

在雅思考试里，**其实极少会在小作文只出现一个饼图让你描述的**，通常是单一饼图+其他类型的图（如柱状图、表格等）。

遇到单一个饼图的话，应该把它独立成一个主体段，段里按照不同元素的占比，从大到小按顺序写。

写作时注意**需要加上连接词，使句子之间的衔接更紧密、读起来更流畅**。

不知各位烤鸭有没有注意到：在描述每一个比例的时候，表示“销售额”的名词都在不断的变换，“**sales**”, “**items sold**”, “**total revenue**”, “**turnover**”，这正是雅思作文评分标准中Lexical Resource（词汇多样化）的要求。

除了学习上面的句型外，各位在描述对象时还要注意用同义词、近义词，甚至是反义词变换。

**>> 第二类：**有表示时间推移的，题目通常含有不只有一个饼图，通常是一个图表示一个时间节点。

The floor plans provided **depict** the **layout** changes that have taken place in the Central Library over the past two decades.

Twenty years ago, the library's organization was quite straightforward, **with** specific areas **dedicated to** different media and book genres. CDs, videos, and computer games were placed **immediately** to the left **upon** entrance, **followed by** a section for adult fiction books. Opposite these areas, children’s books were located to the right, **with adult non-fiction books further in**. The central part of the library housed tables and chairs for reading, **flanked** by a reading room for newspapers and magazines. The inquiry desk was **positioned** at the **rear** center, **serving as** a hub for tickets, book returns, and general questions.

In the present-day layout, the library has undergone a noticeable transformation with a focus on **modernization** and **multipurpose** use. The entrance now leads directly to an area with sofas and space **dedicated to** storytelling events, **indicating** a shift towards more interactive and communal activities. The children's fiction books section remains in the same area, but now it **is complemented with** sofas, **suggesting** a more comfortable and family-friendly **atmosphere**. The adult fiction books have been **relocated** next to a new lecture room, **showing an emphasis on educational functions**. A significant addition is the computer room, **replacing** the old reading room, **illustrating** the digital shift in information consumption. The entire section of all reference books has been **centralized**, **reflecting** the perhaps reduced volume of physical reference materials. The inquiry desk has been replaced by an information desk, and self-service machines have been introduced, **indicating** a move towards automation and self-help. Finally, a café has been introduced, **suggesting** a trend towards creating social spaces within public libraries.

Overall, the Central Library has shifted from a traditional book and media-focused layout to a more dynamic, multi-use space that accommodates technological advancements and changes in public interaction with library services.

The last 20 years have witnessed a resounding change happened in the central library.

Two decades ago, the organization of the central library was quite straightforward. With the reading room located on the left side of the entrance, which stored newspaper and magazines, the enquiry desk was just on the opposite side in order to facilitate people in storing tickets, returning books and so on. In middle of the room was some tables and chairs, as the Adult fiction books and Adult non-fiction books ranged in their left and right relatively. While further in the library, the room for CDs, videos and computer games came into eyes on the left hand. What opposite was the rooms for children's books.

Nowadays, the layout of the library is more complicated but more convenient for readers. On the left side, computer room is the first one catching our eyes, followed by an open area for all reference books. Further in, there is the room for children's fiction books, which even equipped with sofas, creating a cozy environments for children to read. And there will sometimes be some storytelling events. Also in the right hand side, the cafe, self-service machines, information desks ,Adult fiction books and lecture room are ranked relatively to meet the diverse needs of readers.

Overall, the Central Library has shifted from a traditional book and media-focused layout to a more dynamic, multi-use space that accommodates technological advancements and changes in public interaction with library services.
